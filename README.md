# ♟️ Quarto
3D-printable copy of Blaise Müller's Quarto – think "4D tic-tac-toe on steroids."

## Assembly
- [ ] Print one copy of each of the objects in `gameboard`, in a colour of your choice.
- [ ] Print one copy of each of the 8 objects in `pieces`, in a colour of your choice. 
- [ ] Print a second copy of each of the 8 objects in `pieces`, this time in a different colour.
- [ ] This is a travel-friendly version of Quarto. 32 Neodymium magnets (3x3mm) are required to snap each of the 16 pieces to the 16 gameboard squares.

## Instructions
There are 16 distinct pieces, each representing a unique permutation of 4 attributes:
- colour (eg. white or grey, or whatever colours you choose)
- height (tall or short)
- shape (square or circular)
- "filled-in-ness" (hollow or solid top)

The game is played on a 4x4 board.

The objective of Quarto is to place pieces on the board to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal of four pieces, all of which share *at least* one attribute (eg. all are square).  

One more odd rule: Each player chooses the piece that the other player must place on the board. For instance, on the first turn, Player 2 gives a piece of their choice to Player 1. Player 1 must then place that piece on the board, and then select a piece from the 15 remaining for Player 2 to place on the board. The game proceeds in this manner until a player wins or there is a tie.
